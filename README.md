# Kanban Board â€“ Clauses of Service

This repository demonstrates a **basic Kanban board** used to explain the four **Clauses of Service** in the Kanban method. It's designed for Agile teams, trainers, and workshop facilitators.

## ðŸ“‹ What are Clauses of Service?

Clauses of Service define how different types of work items are treated in terms of **priority**, **urgency**, and **handling policies**.

### ðŸ”´ Expedite
- Highest priority work
- Bypasses WIP limits
- Typically used for production incidents or critical fixes

### ðŸŸ  Fixed Date
- Must be delivered by a specific date
- Planned ahead, often tied to events or marketing campaigns

### ðŸŸ¡ Standard
- Default work type
- Delivered in order of priority
- Follows normal WIP limits and policies

### ðŸ”µ Intangible
- Low visibility and low urgency
- Often includes technical debt, infrastructure improvements, or refactoring

## ðŸ§© Board Structure

The board is structured with a column for each service class:
- **Expedite**
- **Fixed Date**
- **Standard**
- **Intangible**

Each column contains one or more example tasks with visual icons (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”µ) to indicate the clause.
